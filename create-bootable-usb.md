# Create an Arch Linux installer USB drive

1.  Download Arch Linux `iso` from https://www.archlinux.org/download/
1.  Insert a usb key with a capacity greater than the ISO size

## From Linux

```console
// Erase disk using fdisk and "d" command
> sudo -i
> cat path/to/arch-linux.iso > /dev/sdX; sync
> exit
```

## From MacOS

1.  Convert the `.iso` file to `.img` using the `convert` option of `hdiutil`:

    ```console
    hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o /path/to/target.img /path/to/source.iso
    ```

1.  Make sure the USB device is unmounted and execute:

    ```console
    sudo dd if=/path/to/target.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
    ```

1.  Run:

    ```console
    diskutil eject /dev/diskN
    ```

## From Windows

1.  Download Rufus from http://rufus.akeo.ie
1.  Launch Rufus and select the following parameters:

    - Partition scheme: "GPT partition scheme for UEFI"

      MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) are two different ways of storing the partitioning information on a drive. This information includes where partitions start and begin, so your operating system knows which sectors belong to each partition and which partition is bootable. GPT is MBR's improved successor and is the one used in this tutorial. For more details, see [What’s the Difference Between GPT and MBR When Partitioning a Drive?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-difference-between-gpt-mbr-when-partitioning-drive-tiwari)

    * File system: "FAT32"

      For a bootable device to be seen by a UEFI system, the device must be formatted using FAT32.

    * Cluster Size: 4096 bytes

      A cluster is the smallest logical amount of disk space that can be allocated to hold a file. It mostly affects performance and wasted disk space. For a live USB, the default cluster size is good enough. The default cluster size for a disk with a few gigabytes of space and formatted with FAT32 is 4096 bytes. See [Default cluster size for NTFS, FAT, and exFAT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/140365/default-cluster-size-for-ntfs-fat-and-exfat) for more details.

    * Check "Create a bootable disk using ...", select the Arch ISO image file and choose "DD Image" (Disk Image mode).

      [ISO images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image) are binary file that contains uncompressed exact copy of a file system. They were originally designed for optical media file systems such as [ISO-9660](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660) or [Universal Disk Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format) (UDF).

      Not every ISO images are bootable. To make such an image bootable, it needs to follow the [El-Torito](https://wiki.osdev.org/El-Torito) specification.

      At this point, the ISO image would be bootable only by an optical disc media. To make it bootable on both optical disk media and USB media, one need to run the [ISOHybrid command](https://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid) from syslinux. This command postprocesses the ISO image file by enriching its file system with a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition, in order for BIOS/UEFI systems to consider it as a bootable hard disk. The Arch ISO image file is a ISOHybrid image.

      **ISO image mode** partition and format the USB in a way that Windows can always understand and using the whole capacity of the drive. Each individual file and directory from the ISO image is then copied onto the newly created file system.

      **Disk Image mode** (a.k.a. "DD Image") will create an exact bit-for-bit clone of the ISO image to the media. As a consequence, the media will not be recognize as a regular USB stick anymore: Windows might not be able to access its content and the size will appear shrinked to the ISO size.

      Since ISOHybrid images comes with their own file system and partitions, one need to select the "Disk Image" mode.
